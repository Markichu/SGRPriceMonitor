# DEPRECATED - Sögur project has been discontinued.
The Sögur project was discontinued. This widget relied on the Sögur and Coingecko API's, these both no longer function since the project was ended. This project is still a good example of how the ApexCharts library can be used to make a responsive price chart.
## SGRPriceMonitor
A widget that shows the current and historical price of Sögur as supplied by the Sögur and CoinGecko API's.
